_Incident response_ (IR) is a set of information security policies and procedures that you can use to identify, contain, and eliminate cyberattacks.


*challenges in cyber incident-response*
---

- identify suspected incident
- establish objectives of investigation and respons
- analyze avaible information
- find what actually happend 
- identify what assets have been compromised
- find what information has been disclosed/deleted/corrupted
- find who did it , why
- find how attacker got initial entry
- find potential impact
- investigate to identify and prosecute perpetrators

*Incident-response life cycle*
---

- **prepare**
	- conduct criticality assessment
		- defined critical assets, threats
		- apply security controls
		- raise awareness
		- determine bussiness impact
	- carry out threat analysis
		- technical infra supporting critical assets
		- threat landscape
		- threats concerned about
		- source of threats
		- possible threat vectors (internet, unauthorized USB)
		- vulnerabilities to each threat
	- consider impacts on 
		- people
			- organize cyber incident-response team
		- process
			- determine methodologies for dealing with incident
		- technology 
			- configure systems/network to air detection and response
		- information
			- establish relevent information
	- create controled environment
		- patch managment policy, access controls , firewalls
		- mfa , certs , whitelisting, IDS, IPS
		- continuous monitoring, proactive APT assessments, virtualization 
		- sensitive data segrigation
- **respond**
	- identify incident 
		- identify suspected incident
		- analyze avaible info
		- find what actually happend
		- find if its a organised attack or not
	- objectives and investigate situation
		- understand the incident
		- use cyber threat intelligence
		- conduct triage ( classify, prioritise, assign to personnel )
		- carry out first response 
	- take action
		- contain incident
		- destroy cause of incident
		- gather evidance
	- recovery systems
		- confirm remediation has been successful
		- recovery plans should include 
			- rebuild infected systems 
			- replace compromised files with clean versions
			- remove temporary constraints during containment period
			- reset compromised account passwords
			- install patches, change passwords etc 
			- test system 
- **follow-up**
	- investigate the incident 
		- problem cause, root cause, quantify bussiness impact 
		- identify perpetrator
	- report to relevant stakeholders
		- what do i have to report
		- who to report ( low enforcement, CERTs, partners)
		- how much to share
		- in what format to share
	- post-incident review
		- how well staff handled
		- was information availible
		- what actions would prevent similar incidents in future
		- were there unforeseen events that could have prevented
		- lessons learnt 
	- communication and build on lessons learned
	- update key information, controls and processes
	- conduct trend analysis
		- evaluate patterns and trends of incidents
		- common factors that have influenced incidents
		- find effectiveness of controls
		- understand cost and impacts
