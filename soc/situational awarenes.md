#situational-awareness 

### *What is going on in your environment?*

> Being aware of a situation. by paying attention to detail is *situational awareness*

#### *Three segments of situational awareness*

- Perception  - ability to sense through senses
- comprehension - ability to understand something
- Projection - an estimate for the future situation

#### *Usage of situational Awareness*

- risk assesment 
- cyber-security prevention/detection
- security hardening
- response to attacks/compramize 

### *We will think of situational awareness in terms of four components*

-  know what the system is
	- devices on network, no of users etc
-  track the digital information in the system
	- data of users
-  understand the behaviour (abnormal vs normal)
- react to abnormal behaviours

#threat-intelligence

*Threat Intelligence*
--

> Process of acquiring knowladge about threats to an environment

**<u>Cyber threat intelligence</u>**

> cyber threat intelligence is the process of taking pieces information about a cyber attack and identifying the context

#### Threat Intelligence & Situational Awareness

- collecting and analysing cyber domain threat
- information can be collected using
	- individuals
	- organizations
	- systems
- if it collects, processes, spread or acts on information its part of intelligence

#information-env

*Information Environment*
--

> Collection of individuals, organizations and systems that collect, process, spread , or act on information.

**<u>This can be broken into three domains</u>**

- physical  - can be used to take contextual information
	- location
	- environmental hazards
- information  - collection of security-information for the use of situational awareness
- cognitive - computer human interaction
	- systems are designed to be user driven
	- accurate data can be misinterpreted
	- solving issues
	- applying knowlage 
	- processing information

The information environment can be broken into three distant domains,  but these are not separate and information can pass across different domains 

- cyber-physical  (CPS)
	- CPS are collections of physical and computer components that are integrated with each other to operate a process safely and efficiently. eg: robots 
- social-technical 
	- allow people to work with technology in ways that benefit society and advance organizational goals eg: social-media
