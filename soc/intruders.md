*Who is APT ?*
=

Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)  groups are classified as organizations that lead attacks on a country. 

APT possesses extraordinary skill and resource. 

APT groups, as well as those sponsored by a nation-state, often aim to gain undetected access to a network and then remain silently persistent, establish a backdoor, and/or steal data, as opposed to causing damage. Once inside the target network, APTs leverage malware to achieve their directives, which may include acquiring and exfiltrating data.

Often involve  

- Intelligence gathering  
- Initial exploitation  
- Command and control to achieve persistent access  
- Privilege escalation  
- Data exfiltration
