* Footprinting is the process of collecting information about a target and its environment. 
* Passive footprinting - No interactions with targets ( Search engines, DNS, Web services )
* Active footprinting - Interactions with targets ( Query name servers, search for files, extract links from target websites )
* Information obtained - * Organisation ( address, contacts, background ) 
*                                       Network ( domains, structure, topology, IP addresses )
*                                       Systems ( OS's, locations, public email addresses )

# Benefits and threats
* First step in assessing organisational security and risks 
* Social engineering
* System and network attacks
* Information leakage
* Privacy loss
* Corporate esponiage

# Web services footprinting 
* Level 1 - Top level domain { owned by a company }
   Start with google generic search
* Level 2 - Sub domains { sublist3r}
   Python script
* Level 3 - HTTPs servers

# Footprinting countermeasures
* Restrict access to social neworking from the organisation network
* Encrypt, password protect, block access to sensitive information
* Secure web servers against information leakage
