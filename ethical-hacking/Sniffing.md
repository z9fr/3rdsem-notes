Packet sniffing - process of monitoring and capturing all data packets passing through a given network

Where - Tapping point ( somewhere along the path of the packets )

How - Hardware recieves traffic/packets

Why - to see whats inside the packets

# Access

Legit/controlled - passive switching, physical tapping device, port mirroring

Attack - physical tapping device, active sniffing

# Outcome

Access content of the packets
Alter content
Spoof destination

# Attacks and defence mechanisms

MAC attack 
Switch port stealing

Configure port security

# MAC spoofing/duplication

Spoof a MAC address with the MAC address of a legit user
Used to bypass access control mechanisms

# IRDP spoofing

ICMP routing discovery protocol ( IRDP ) discover active routers on the network by listening to router ads

# DNS attack protection
