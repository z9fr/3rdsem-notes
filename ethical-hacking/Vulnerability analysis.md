Research is needed - 
* to gather information about newly discovered threat                   
* to find weaknesses in the OS
* to understand information that helps prevent security problems

# Vulnerability assessment
Vulnerability assessment is scanning networks, recognises, measures and classifies vulnerabilities in computer systems

Why it is needed - 
* Identify weaknesses that could be exploited
* Predict the effectiveness of additional security measures

Active scanning - interacting with targets
Passive scanning - observing traffic

Can identify -
* weak network configs
* accounts with weak passwords
* missing patches and hotfixes
* IP TCP/UDP ports that are listening

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
Uses - 
* prioritize vulneribility remediation activities
* calculate severity of vulneribilities

Helps to capture characteristics of a vulneribility and produce a numerical score of its severity

Three metrics - 
* Base metric - inherent qualities of a vulneribility
* Temporal metric - features that change during the lifetime of a vulneribility
* Env metric - vulneribilities based on env and implementation

CVE ( common vulneribilities and exposures ) is a publicly available dictionary of standardised identifies for common software vulnerabilities and exposures

NVD ( National Vulnerability Database ) is the US government repo of standard based vulnererbility management data. 

NVD includes - 
* DB of security checklist reference
* Misconfigurations
* Impact metrics
* Profduct names

# Vulnerability management lifecycle

Identify assets and create baseline -> vulnerability scan -> risk assessment -> Remedition -> Verification -> Monitor

# Vulnerability classification

* Buffer overflows
* Unpatched servers
* Design flaw
* OS flaw
* App flaw
* Open services
* Default passwords

# Types of vulnarability assessment

* Active
* Passive 
* External
* Internal
* Host based
* Network based
* Application based
* DB
* Wireless
* Distribution
* Credentialed
* Non credentialed
* Manual 
* Automatic 

# Approaches to vulnarability assessment

* Product based - org internal network
* Service based - inside and outside network
* Tree based - differing strategies for each machine
* Inference based - information from earlier phases to determine subsequent strategy
