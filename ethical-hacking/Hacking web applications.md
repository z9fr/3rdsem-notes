Architecture - 
* Client layer ( interaction with web clients )
* Business layer ( enable processing of data and sending to be displayed to client by server )
* DB layer 

# Characteristics of web services
* XML based
* loosely coupled
* Remote procedure calls support

Vulnerability stack
* Layer 1 Security
* Layer 2 Network
* Layer 3 OS
* layer 4 DB
* layer 5 Web server
* layer 6 third party components
* layer 7 custom web applications - business logic

# Web application threats

* Injection flaws -  application vulnerabilities that allow untrusted data to be interpreted and executed as part of a command or query
* Broken authentication
* Sensitive data exposure
* Broke access control - An attacker identifies a flaw related to access control, bypasses the authentication, and then compromises the network.

# Attack methodology

Web application hacking methodology -
* Footprint web infastructure 
* Analyse web applications
* Bypass client side controls
* Attack authentication mechanisms
* Attack authentication schemes

# Webhooks

User defined HTTP callback or push APIs ( raised based on events triggered , once invoked supplied data to other applications)

# WebAPI hacking

* identify target
* Detect security standards
* Indentify surface attacks
* Launch attacks
* Exploit insecure configs
* Login stuffing attacks
* API DDoS attacks
* OAuth attacks
