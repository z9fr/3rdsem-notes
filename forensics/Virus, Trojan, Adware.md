A virus will find a host and will replicate and distribute them attached to a file

Virus classifications - 
* Boot sector virus ( infects first sector of hard drive where Master boot record ( MBR) is stored)
* File deleting virus ( deletes critical files that are part of the OS or data files )
* Mass mailer virus 
* Macro viruses  ( A macro is a way to automate and simplify a task that you perform repeatedly in MS office, usually stored as part of the document or spreadsheet and can travel to other systems when these files are transferred to another computers. )
* Polymorphic viruses ( change their appearance and change their code every time they infect a different system )
* Armored viruses ( designed and written to make itself difficult to detect or analyze )
* Stealth viruses ( capability to hide from operating system or anti-virus software by making changes to file sizes or directory structure )
* Retrovirus ( tries to attack and disable the anti-virus application running on the computer, considered as anti-antivirus )

# Stages of virus lifecycle 

* Design
* Replication
* Launch
* Detection
* Incorporation
* Removal

# Trojan horse

A type of malware that downloads onto a computer disguised as a legit program

Deletes data, blocks data, modifies data, copying data, disrupts performance of computers or networks 

Types of trojan horse
* Backdoor trojans ( designed to grant unwanted access for a remote attack )
* DDoS trojans ( designed to conduct a DoS attack from an infected computer on a pre-defined address )
* Data sending trojans
* Destructive trojans 
* Proxy trojans
* Security software disabler trojans

# External threats

* Lonewolf hackers
* Script kiddies
* Cyber terrorists ( Amazon DDoS attack, SolarWinds supply chain attack, Twitter celebrities attack )

# Protection measures

Detection methods have evolved to keep pace with malware behaviour - 
* Signature based - Uses generic signatures to identify malware like behaviour
Offers potential to identify previously known strains

* Reputation based - Determines if a suspect file is malicious based on reputation rating. monitors endpoints to gather data about files. age, download source, digital signature and prevalance are used to establish reputation rating 

* Heuristics
