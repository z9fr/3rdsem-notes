Forensic process

- Acquisition
- Examine/analyse
- Present

Criminal forensics -

- brought into action by criminal investigation by the Police.
- Strict procedures due to legal reliablility
- Cost not usually an object

Corporate forensics -

- Deals with companies
- Policing performed by network administrators
- Do not take place within a sealed lab
- Costs and viability must be considered

Forensic principles -

- Consistency with all legal systems
- Use of a common language
- Durability
- Ability to cross international boundaries
- Ability to instill confidence in integrity of evidence
- Applicability to all forensic evidence

Principles of computer based evidence -

- Original data shouldnt be changed
- If original data is to be accessed, should provide relevance to why
- An audit should be created and preserved. An independent third party should be able to provide same result
- Person in charge of investigation should adhere above three

Rules of evidence -

- Admissible - Must be used in court
- Authentic - Relevant to incident in relevant way
- Complete
- Reliable - No question about authenticity and veracity
- Believable - Clear

Chain of custody -

- protects integrity of evidence
- Effective process of documenting the complete journey of the evidence during the life of the case

Evidence life cycle -

- Identification
- Storage
- Testing of data
- Re-testing
- Presentation by legal testimony
- Return to production

# Search and seize

- Scene of crime ( securing the scene ) -> Search ( systematic search, grids, lines, spirals ) -> Collection ( bagging evidence, photographing, notes ) -> Storage ( avoid detioration, contamination, logging all access ) -> Lab examination ( preliminary testing, secondary testing, written report )

Storage -

- Keep magnetic devices away
- Use anti-shock
- Maintain chain of custody
- Store in secured area

# Computer based acquisition

Order of volatility

- Main physical memory
- Secondary memory
- Network state
- Running processes
- Disk
- Floppies
- Archival media

Bitstream - Bit for Bit copy of the original. Not sufficient but practically only way available

OS only pay attention to the live system structure

- slack, residue, deleted etc. not indexed

Backups do not capture above data and they modify the timestamps of data, contaminating the timeline

# Integrity of evidence

- One way hash function
  to ensure integrity, a mechanism called fingerprint is required
