## why perform malware analysis

- determine what exactly happend 
- determine the malicious intent
- identify indicators of compromise 
- find the intruder complexity 
- find the exploited vuln
- identify extend of the damage
- find signatures for ids

*Types of Malware Analysis*
==

*Static Analysis*
---

- investigating without running or installing 
- compiling the code to binary results in data loss. this can make the analysis difficult
- examination of binary without executin is manual 
	- extraction of vital data like data strucutres, funcions, call graphs


*Dynamic Malware Analysis*
---

- study the malware behavious by running it in a sandbox
- system baselining - create and capture the testing state
- host integrity monitoring - studying changers 

---

*Preparing Testbed*
==

- Isolated test network to host the testbed and isolated network services like DNS
- target machines installed with variety of OS config and state
- snapshots and re-imaging tools to wipe and rebuild the target machine quickly
- tools for testing
	- imaging tools
	- file/data analysis - for static analysis
	- registry/config tools
	- sandbox - for dynamic analysis
	- log analysers
	- network capture

----

*File Fingerprinting*
--

> getting file hash of the binary to identify and track data across a  network, which can also be used to verify if any changes are made to the binary


*Local and Online Malware Scanning*
--

- scan binary with up-to-date antivirus software
- upload code to virustotal to get analysis


*Performing String Searches*
